# Image data preparation

This document contains recommendations of how to organise your image data, e.g. when seeking consultancy at EMBL-CBA.

## Select a minimal set of representative examples

Select **two** (not more) images that ideally show a clear and biologically relevant difference.

For example the first image could be a control sample, whereas the second image has been treated in some way.

Please organise those two images into a folder structure similar to the one below:

- minimal-example-data
    - condition01
        - condition01_image01
    - condition02
        - condition02_image01
    - README.txt

As indicated please also add a short README text file where you describe in a few words what the difference is that you see between the conditions.
